# Contrastive Feature Bin Loss for Monocular Depth Estimation
This repository contains the official implementation of CFBLoss, as presented in our paper:


## Usage
We set all settings to be identical to those of the corresponding model. Please refer to each model's repository for the environment required to use it.

The code modifications for each model are as follows.

**PixelFormer**

**MIM-Depth-Estimation**

**Depth Anything**
